[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindYOLOv5.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "YOLOv5", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "YOLOv5" with any
  of the following names:

    YOLOv5Config.cmake
    yolov5-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "YOLOv5" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "YOLOv5_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "YOLOv5"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
